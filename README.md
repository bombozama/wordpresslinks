# Widgetkit Content Provider: Wordpress Links

This plugin allows to use the old [Wordpress Link Manager](https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager) as a content provider for [Widgetkit](http://yootheme.com/widgetkit).

* Enables the Link Manager on Wordpress v. >= 3.5
* Content is selectable by Link Categories or by manual input of Link id's.
* Users can build from simple lists of links to complex galleries by using the link's image attribute.
